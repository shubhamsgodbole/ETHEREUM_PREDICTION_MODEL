# ETHEREUM_PREDICTION_MODEL
This project is defined to predict high-fluctuation Ethereum price using Support Vector Regression algorithm in Machine Learning. The dataset of parameters is collected from https://finance.yahoo.com/crypto/, since 2015.
## Conclusion
Crypto-currency price prediction is not so feasible when applied to real world data, because the volitality of cryptocurruncies is too much, and the features are less. However, it may be of use to predict a certain range in which the price may lie.
